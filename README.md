<h3 align="left">Software Developer and Analist</h3>

I develop Softwares, Web Applications, Data Analysis and Strutures since 2018. I'm great at managing projects, tasks and problemns, I always like to take a step back and analyse the whole problem, and them making a debug process step by step.  

The main area I'm passionate about in IT is Software Engineering and all types of analysing methods that can help in coding as a whole.

<h3 align="left">A little about me</h3>

Currently I'm taking a degree in Computer Science at UTFPR (Federal IT College from Paran√° - Brazil). Also I have already completed Technical IT education at IFSP (Federal Institute of S√£o Paulo).

I'm from a small town in the interior of S√£o Paulo State called S√£o Jo√£o da Boa Vista. I grew up there until I turned 18, when I gained admission to UTFPR for my college studies. I have always been passionate about computers, gaming, and problem-solving as a whole. 
When I began studying programming and coding, I immediately developed a strong interest in it. From that point on, I decided to make coding my main goal in life.

Fell free to know more about me and my codes viewing my projects! 
(Some are old codes that I did when I started studying. They are here just to remind me of past projects.)
