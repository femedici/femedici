<h3 align="left">Software Engineer and Analist</h3>

I'm taking a degree in Computer Science at UTFPR (Federal Technical College from Paran√° - Brazil). I have already completed my Technical School education at IFSP (Federal Institute of S√£o Paulo).

<h3 align="left">A little about me</h3>

I'm from a small town in the interior of S√£o Paulo State called S√£o Jo√£o da Boa Vista. I grew up there until I turned 18, when I gained admission to UTFPR for my college studies. I have always been passionate about computers, gaming, and problem-solving as a whole. 
When I began studying programming and coding, I immediately developed a strong interest in it. From that point on, I decided to make technology my main focus in life.

Fell free to know more about me and my codes viewing my projects! 
(Some are old codes that I did when I started studying. They are here just to remind me of past projects.)
