<h3>Back-end Developer</h3>

I have been actively engaged in software development, web applications and data analysis since 2018. Proficient in project management and adept at troubleshooting, I approach challenges by taking a comprehensive view before systematically debugging issues step by step. My passion within IT lies in Software Engineering and employing various estrutures and methods to enhance coding practices as a whole.

<h3 >A little about me</h3>

Currently I'm taking a degree in Computer Science at UTFPR (Federal IT College from Paran√° - Brazil). Also I have already completed Technical IT education at IFSP (Federal Institute of S√£o Paulo).
I have always been passionate about computers, gaming, and problem-solving as a whole. 
When I began studying programming and coding, I immediately developed a strong interest in it. From that point on, I decided to make coding my main goal in life.

Fell free to know more about me and my codes viewing my projects! 
(Some are old codes that I did when I started studying. They are here just to remind me of past projects.)
