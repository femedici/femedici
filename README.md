<h3 align="left">Analist and Software Engineer</h3>

I'm studing at UTFPR Computer Science. Already finished Technical School at Instituto Federal S√£o Paulo. 
Made various projects during my graduation, with made my skills increase and develop better coding and analysis mindset.

Some projects I developed and made part of:
- My Own City: A software that chooses cities according to your personal taste and workspace. It was created with Java, JFrame and MySQL and is based on object-       oriented methodology.

- Brewing Space: Project of a Social Media focused on people who like homebrewed beer. This project also involved production methods for different types of beer,       guides, and software to support production. 
I was the lead analyst of the project, which allowed me to improve my communication skills, software development skills, documentation skills, and knowledge of         software engineering in practice.

- OO Calculator: It's an abstraction of a calculator using c++ and pure object-oriented model. Makes all operations using Digits, Keyboard, Display, Cpu and other classes integrated.
